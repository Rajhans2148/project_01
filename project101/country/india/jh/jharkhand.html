<b>About Goddess Chhinnamasta</b>

The name Chhinnamasta means ‚ÄúShe who is beheaded.‚Äù The goddess is depicted as standing over the bodies of Kama (desire) and Rati 
(passion), holding her severed head in one hand and a scimitar in the other, with three blood streams feeding her and her attendants.
It is a symbol of self-control, victory over ego, and spiritual liberation.
This form is rare and considered extremely tantric and powerful, which is why the temple attracts both devotees and mystics from all 
over India.

<b>Religious Significance</b>

Rajrappa is counted among the 51 Shakti Peethas of India.

It is especially important in Tantric worship, where devotees perform sadhana (spiritual practice) seeking blessings from the goddess.

On special days like Navratri, Kali Puja, and Tuesdays, the temple becomes heavily crowded.

Note: Animal sacrifice (mainly goats) is still practiced here by some devotees as part of traditional beliefs.

<b>Spiritual & Cultural Experience</b>

The temple complex has multiple small shrines, including those of Shiva, Hanuman, Surya, and other deities.

Nearby riverbanks are used for ritual baths, cremation, and pind daan.

Local tribal and rural communities play a huge role in the temple‚Äôs cultural vibe.

A special Rajrappa Mela (fair) is organized annually which showcases traditional tribal culture, folk songs, and local cuisine.
