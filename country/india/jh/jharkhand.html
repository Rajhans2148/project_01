It is a symbol of self-control, victory over ego, and spiritual liberation.

over India.

It is especially important in Tantric worship, where devotees perform sadhana (spiritual practice) seeking blessings from the goddess.

On special days like Navratri, Kali Puja, and Tuesdays, the temple becomes heavily crowded.

Note: Animal sacrifice (mainly goats) is still practiced here by some devotees as part of traditional beliefs.

The temple complex has multiple small shrines, including those of Shiva, Hanuman, Surya, and other deities.

Nearby riverbanks are used for ritual baths, cremation, and pind daan.
